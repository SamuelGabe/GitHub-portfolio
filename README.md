# About Me
Hi! I'm Samuel Gabe and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Nottingham with a 2:1 Masters degree in theoretical physics. In my degree I completed various projects and many of these projects involved use of Python and working with data. Over the last few months I have taken courses on LinkedIn Learning to improve my skills in various areas, like SQL, JavaScript and data analysis.

# My Projects
## Final Year Project
In my final year project, I worked alongside my project partner to analyse a large data set containing data from simulations of the early Universe. We used Python to work with these data and gain insights into the evolution of the early Universe. 

**Skills:**
* Python
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
* Using Python to work with data
* Collaboration with supervisor and project partner

## Traffic flow project
This was a mini-project where I used Python to find out how traffic flow is affected depending on how many lanes there are. To do this I used a pre-existing model of traffic flow, then adapted it to a two-lane model, and compared traffic flow in both circumstances.

**Skills**
* Using Python to solve problems
* Creating mathematical models and implementing them in code
* Using this code to conduct investigations

## App Design Project
I took a module from the Computer Science department where I made an app design for a festival and tested it on users. 

**Skills**
* UI/UX design
* Testing on users and gathering feedback

## Third Year Project
In my third year project, I worked with a partner to use machine learning to categorise images of space based on whether or not they had been gravitationally lensed. We successfully accomplished this task and created a model which categorised the images with 96% accuracy. 

**Skills**
* Python
* Machine learning
  * TensorFlow

## Investigating the Rotating Wave Approximation
The rotating wave approximation (RWA) is an approximation used in quantum mechanics to approximate a quantum system. In this project I used code to investigate how accurate this approximation is by comparing graphs made using the rotating wave approximation, and graphs made with a more accurate model.

**Skills**
* Implementing mathematical models in Python
* Using Python to investigate physics
* NumPy and Matplotlib
